A note about PuTTY
==================

The use of PuTTY as an SSH client for Windows users is a tradition in our
department.  Most of you will have used PuTTY.  It is simple and reliable,
though it lacks the features of newer SSH clients, like terminal font styles
and coloring.  There are alternatives to PuTTY which you are free to use. 

If you have a preferred SSH client, use it instead.  If you have the option and
the technical know-how, I recommend using ssh under Powershell.  A Linux Live
CD is also an option if you want the features of Linux ssh, but don't want to
commit to installing Linux to your hard drive.
