 \subsection{Subsection B.1}

 \begin{frame}
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Here is slide 3, in Section B, Subsection B.1
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item This is an enumerated sublist
       \item I like to have abbreviations for many of the commands, such
             as starting or ending lists, or creating an item
     \end{enumerate}
     \item Here is a bullet point on the same top-most level
   \end{itemize}
 \end{frame}

 \subsection{Subsection B.2}

 \begin{frame}
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Here is a slide 4, in Section B, Subsection B.2
     \item There are a few advantages for using LaTeX for something like this
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item The source file is in plain-text, and small in size
       \item Plain-text source can be used with version control for
             collaboration on slides
       \item You can use regular expressions to manipulate the source,
             for example to change all enumerated lists into itemized
             lists
       \item It compiles into a PDF, which is cross-platform and is viewed
             the same way on every machine with a PDF reader
       \item No more dragging images into pixel-perfect position
     \end{enumerate}
   \end{itemize}
