Extra Credit Homework 5
=======================

You can earn +8 maximum.  You can do more than +8; I will take the best
combination of problems whose max values add to +8.  I have given you a wide
variety this time in case you don't want to make the foray into the dark side.

This following is for educational use.  Know the laws; read the Louisiana
Revised Statutes, Title 14 for sections on cybercrimes.  I don't condone
law-breaking or getting caught for law-breaking.  Resist the temptation to
brag; the only attention you'll get is the kind you don't want.

Oh, and remember, you learned it from me. ;)


Fox Problems
------------

  1. Port scanning.
       [+1] Read the manual page for ``nmap`` and run it on ``mail.lsu.edu`` to
       scan ports 1-1024. Place a dump of the output in ``portscan.txt``.  Note
       that you can actually connect to the open ports using a utility called
       netcat, or ``nc``.  In the case of port 25, you can communicate via a
       plain-text protocol.

  2. Simple password cracking.
       [+1] John the Ripper is a utility for cracking passwords whose hashes
       are stored in ``/etc/shadow``. You can't normally access
       ``/etc/shadow``, but I have placed a weak password in a file
       ``src/shadow`` under an account with username ``idiot``.  Run ``john``
       on the file to reveal ``idiot``'s password, and send it to me in a file
       called ``password.txt``.

  3. SMS spoofing.
       [+1] Use the textbelt.com service to send a text message to my cell
       phone (2253370226) from the command line.  You can use the command
       ``curl``; follow the syntax on the site.  Let the message contain your
       name so I know it's from you.  You should get a success message if it
       succeeded.  **Do not** send more than two successful messages per day;
       there is a global limit for the server.

  4. Executable hacking. 
       [+2] Run the executable ``bin/protected`` and observe that it requires a
       password.  Using ``gdb`` and ``hexedit``, find and overwrite the
       function call responsible for checking the password with no-op
       instructions (``0x90``).  Call the resulting executable ``cracked``. 

  5. Content-harvesting robots.
       [+4] Read the manual page for ``wget`` and use it to download images of
       cats from ``http://google.com.com/search?q=cats``.  First wget the page,
       then use regex on the HTML to isolate URLs for the images into a file.
       Then use wget with the ``-i`` option to download the images.  Since
       ``wget`` is a known robot, it is normally forbidden access, so you will
       have to spoof the user-agent (e.g. ``-U "Mozilla/Firefox"``) to bypass
       Google's anti-robot security.

       Assemble the commands into a script called ``download-cats.sh``. It
       should download the first 10 images of cats into a folder called
       ``cat-pictures``.





Owl Problems

  6. Write a resume.
       [+2] See ``src/resume.tex`` for my resume.  Modify it to make a resume
       for yourself, and strip it down to one page. Call it ``resume.tex``. 

  7. Intelligent note-taking.
       [+2] The ReStructured Test language is the one in which all my notes are
       written. You can convert a ``.rst`` document to LaTeX source with the
       command ``rst2latex``, then compile it with ``pdflatex`` to produce a
       beautiful PDF document with minimal effort.

       Transcribe a page of your notes from some other class. In your notes,
       make use of **bold**, *italics*, ``teletype``, itemized lists, and
       create at least one table; then convert it to a LaTeX document and
       compile it into PDF.  Call this ``notes.rst``.

  8. Better presentation slides.
       [+2] The ``beamer`` class in LaTeX can be used to create very nice
       slides.  Using ``src/slides.tex`` as a basis, create a set of at least
       16 slides with 4 sections, each with 4 subsections, in the Copenhagen
       style as in the example.  

       You can transcribe your notes; or if you have a presentation for a
       class, take this opportunity to do it in LaTeX.

  9. HTML and CSS (creating a web page).
       [+2] Use ``wget`` or a browser to examine the source code at
       ``www.cct.lsu.edu/~dcastl2``.  Note that you can access other sources,
       such as the CSS code, or other HTML codes, by ``wget``'ing or, in a
       browser, clicking on the links (see the "View Source" option in most
       browsers).

       Design a single-page web page (called ``page.html``) with information
       about yourself. Create a two-column design using ``div`` elements.
