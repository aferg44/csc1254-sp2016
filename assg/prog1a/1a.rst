1. Hello writer.
     [16] Write a program which writes a program which prints ``Hello, world!``
     to the screen [8]. Call the source file ``hello-writer.cpp``, and the 
     generated file ``hello.cpp``. Ensure that the generated file compiles
     and runs [8].

2. Color drawing.
     [16] Write a program to print a color drawing to the screen.  Use the
     provided ``color.h`` and refer to ``color.cpp`` for example.  The 
     drawing should be 8 rows x 8 cols [8] and use at least three colors [8].
     Call this ``color-drawing.cpp``.

3. File typeout.
     [16] Write a program to read in a filename via stdin and type out the 
     text in the file [8] at 30Hz [8] to stdout. Use the file ``typeout.cpp``
     for reference.  Call this ``file-typeout.cpp``.

4. Clock.
     [16] Write a program to tell the time in mm/dd/yy hh::mm::ss format [8];
     it should refresh every second [8], clearing the screen and displaying at
     the bottom of the screen.  Refer to the ``ctime.cpp`` code.  Call this 
     ``clock.cpp``.

5. Character count.
     [32] Write a program to count the number of spaces [8], alphanumeric
     characters [8], and lines [8] in a file.  It should accept the filename
     via stdin, and print the numbers space-delimited, followed by a courtesy
     newline [8].  Call this ``char-count.cpp``.

     a. Word count.
          [16] Additional points if instead of alphanumeric characters,
          it counts alphabetic words (a string of one or more alphabetic
          characters).  In this case call it ``word-count.cpp``.

6. ASCII art.
     [32] Write a program to print out a user-supplied string in an ASCII
     font of your design [16].  The string should print horizontally [16].
     Use the skeleton ``ascii-art.cpp`` for reference, and the program
     ``ascii-art`` for example execution.
     
     a. Colored ASCII art.
          [16] Addiitional points if the output is colored such that no
          two consecutive letters share the same color. In this case,
          call it ``ascii-art-color.cpp``.

7. ASCII animation.
     [64] Write a program to print a colored animation to the screen.  Use
     the provided ``color.h`` [8] and refer to ``color.cpp`` for example.  The 
     animation should be 8 rows x 8 cols [8], have a framerate of 30 Hz [8],
     last for exactly 10 seconds [8], use at least three colors [16], be such
     that no two frames in the animation are the same [16], and be unique [-64].
     Call this ``asciimation.cpp``.
