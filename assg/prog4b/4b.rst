This is an exploration of other languages (ones which I know). If you are a CSC
major, I would recommend you dabble in all of these.  Note that you will need
to enable X11 forwarding on your ssh client to use a lot of the features of
these languages. 


1. BaSH, the shell scripting language.
     [+1] Write a shell script which takes an argument X, displays X.cpp on the
     screen (line-numbered; use nl) until the user hits Enter, then compiles
     X.cpp into an executable X, and runs it. Call it ``run.sh``. If you place
     it into a directory ~/bin, you can use it from anywhere. 

2. LaTeX, a markup language for creating papers.
     [+2] Write a LaTeX document to explain integration by parts to a MATH 1552
     student.  It should contain the formula and an example. Call it
     ``calculus.tex``. Your teachers would be most impressed if you turned in
     homework in this language.

3. Python, a dynamic scripting language (how to cheat in calculus).
     [+2] Using the sympy library, write a Python script to evaluate for the
     function f(x)=sin(x)/x, the limits as x->0 and x->oo, the derivative, the
     integral, and the series expansion to five terms.  Call this 
     ``symbolic.py``.  And remember: you learned it from me. ;)

4. PHP, the web programming language.  
     [+2] Write a PHP script to output an HTML table containing a color palette
     with 4096 colors. It should have 16x16x16 shades of RGB of the form
     "0xXXYYZZ" where X, Y, and Z are the hex values 0-F.  Show the hex values
     alongside the colors.  Call this ``palette.php``.  See ``palette.html``
     for a generated file.

5. Java, an object-oriented programming language similar to C++.
     [+2] Write a Java program which prints a Java "Hello, world!" program to
     stdout. Note the similaries to and differences from C++. Call it 
     ``Hello.java``.

6. R, the statistics language (how to cheat in statistics).
     [+2] The file ``scores.dat`` contains a comma-separated list with category
     total scores from this class (identifying information has been removed
     from the file).  Write a script to calculate and print the means and
     standard deviations of all fields.  Also, print the correlation
     coefficient matrix of the data.  Finally, plot a histogram of the total
     score (include eight breaks).  Call this ``analysis.R``.

7. Octave, a scientific computing language (how to cheat in linear algebra).
     [+2] The file ``system.txt`` contains a system of equations. 
     The coefficients of the LHS of the equations makes up the matrix A,
     and the results on the right make up the column vector B. Write an
     octave script to: solve the equation Ax=B, print the determinant of
     A, print the inverse of A, and print the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
     of A.  Call this ``linear.m``.

8. Haskell, a functional programming language.
     [+4] Write a Haskell program to list all permutations of a string.  For
     example if the string is "ABCD", it should give "ABDC", "ACBD", "ACDB",
     etc.    Call this ``permuations.hs``.  I would be very impressed if anyone
     could do this; Haskell is a very hard language for young people to learn.


These languages have different focii.  Scientists and students of linear
algebra benefit from knowing MATLAB/Octave, social scientists from R, and
graduate students and artists from LaTeX and PHP.  The scripting languages are
good for anyone to know.  Haskell is for computer science geeks.
