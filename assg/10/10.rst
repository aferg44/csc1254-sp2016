1. [16] Write a program which writes a program which prints Hello, world! to
        the screen. Call the source file ``hello-writer.cpp``, and the 
        generated file ``hello.cpp``. Ensure that the both files compile and 
        run.

2. [16] Write a program to print a color drawing to the screen.  Use the 
        provided ``color.h`` and refer to ``color.cpp`` for example.  The 
        drawing should be 8 rows x 8 cols and use at least three colors.  
        Call this ``color-drawing.cpp``.

3. [16] Write a program to read in a filename via stdin and type out the text
        in the file at 30Hz to stdout. Use the file ``typeout.cpp`` for 
        reference.  Call this ``file-typeout.cpp``.

4. [16] Write a program to tell the time in mm/dd/yy hh::mm::ss format; it 
        refresh every second, clearing the screen and displaying at the 
        bottom of the screen.  Refer to the ``ctime.cpp`` code.  Call this
        ``clock.cpp``.

5. [32] Write a program to count the number of spaces, alphanumeric characters,
        and lines in a file.  It should accept the filename via stdin, and
        print the numbers space-delimited, followed by a courtesy newline.
        Call this ``char-count.cpp``.

        [16] Additional points if instead of alphanumeric characters, you count
             alphabetic words (a string of one or more alphabetic characters). 
             In this case call it ``word-count.cpp``.

6. [32] Write a program to print out a user-supplied string in an ASCII font
        of your design.  The string should print horizontally. Use the skeleton 
        ``ascii-art.cpp`` for reference, and the program ``ascii-art`` for
        example execution.
        
        [16] Addiitional points if the output is colored such that no two 
             consecutive letters share the same color. In this case, call it 
             ``ascii-art-color.cpp``.

7. [64] Write a program to print a colored animation to the screen.  Use the
        provided ``color.h`` and refer to ``color.cpp`` for example.  The 
        animation should be 8 rows x 8 cols, have a framerate of 30 Hz, last
        for exactly 10 seconds, use at least three colors, be such that no two
        frames in the animation are the same, and be unique. Call this 
        ``asciimation.cpp``.
